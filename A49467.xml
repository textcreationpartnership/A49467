         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Hence it is, that the Lord doth ſo <hi>complain</hi> of his Peoples <hi>Deafneſs</hi> and <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> and checks them for it (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.18, 19, 20.) <hi>Hear ye DEAF, and look ye BLIND, that ye may ſee.

            </p>
            <p>To <hi>clear</hi> Jacob's <hi>Eyes,</hi> to <hi>take away</hi> thoſe thick ſcales of darkneſs, that (through various kinds of <hi>diſtempers</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi>) are grown upon them, that they may <hi>See;</hi> and to <hi>open</hi> his deaf <hi>Ears</hi> that he may <hi>Hear:</hi> the Lord will deal with <hi>Jacob</hi> according to the tenour of theſe words I have choſen to treat of.</p>
            <p>It ſeems neceſſary before I come to the Words, that I mind two things; The <hi>Time</hi> to which, and the <hi>Perſons</hi> to whom, this <hi>Propheſie</hi> in a ſpecial manner belongs.</p>
            <p>In the 24, 25, 26, and 27. Chapters, is a continued uninterrupted <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> of what <hi>great things</hi> the Lord will do <hi>for</hi> and <hi>among</hi> his People.</p>
            <p>That it hath a particular and peculiar Relation to the <hi>laſt times;</hi> and that <hi>theſe dayes</hi> wherein we live, are <hi>thoſe laſt times,</hi> I ſuppoſe will be readily granted, and therefore I need not uſe words to prove it.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>this Propheſie</hi> hath Relation to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I ſuppoſe is as clear; not onely the Prophet's ſpeaking of the <hi>Iſles</hi> (of which the <hi>natural Seed</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> had no poſſeſſion) but the <hi>Work</hi> of God it ſelf treated of, makes it evident.</p>
            <p>This-<hi>Earth</hi> which the Lord ſaith he will <hi>Empty,</hi> in the 24. Chapt. ſome would reſtrain to theſe <hi>Iſlands:</hi> but I would rather ſay, we are to underſtand by it, the whole <hi>Antichriſtian Earth, Babylons Earth,</hi> the old <hi>Serpents Earth,</hi> in which he is bruiſing the <hi>Heel</hi> of the <hi>Womans Seed;</hi> Both, becauſe we find the Prophet ſpeaking of the <hi>utmoſt parts of the Earth</hi> (in the 16. ver. of the 24. Chapter) and becauſe he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſaith (in his 28. Chapt. which hath Relation to <hi>this time</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) <hi>I have heard from the Lord God of Hoſts, a Conſumption even deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33837:6"/>
            <p>But many particulars in theſe Chapters, tell me alſo; That this <hi>Work</hi> of God here ſpoken of, ſhall have its <hi>beginning</hi> in the <hi>Iſlands;</hi> and from thence <hi>iſſue forth</hi> to the <hi>other parts</hi> of the <hi>Earth:</hi> therefore ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſrael ſhall bloſſom and bud, and fill the face of the WORLD with Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, This <hi>People</hi> to whom this Propheſie doth belong, are a <hi>People,</hi> that having been <hi>afflicted formerly</hi> by their Enemies, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents brood, have <hi>encountered, Smitten</hi> thoſe Enemies of theirs: <hi>Hath he ſmitten him, as he SMOTE thoſe that ſmote him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, They are a <hi>People,</hi> that at preſent are under the <hi>Smitings</hi> of their former <hi>ſmitten Enemies: Hath he SMITTEN him as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him?</hi> And that which ſtrengthens me in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting <hi>theſe ſmitings,</hi> to be the <hi>ſmitings</hi> of theſe <hi>two Seeds</hi> againſt each other, is, what the latter part of the Verſe ſpeaks: <hi>Or, is he ſlain according to the ſlaughter of them that are ſlain by him?</hi> I can ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>theſe ſmitings,</hi> may not be the <hi>ſmiting</hi> of the <hi>two Seeds</hi> of each other, as well as the <hi>ſlaying</hi> here mentioned; is <hi>their ſlaying</hi> of each other.</p>
            <p>Again, They are a <hi>People,</hi> that <hi>foreſeeing the riſing up</hi> of theſe their <hi>old Enemies</hi> to <hi>ſmite</hi> them afreſh, endeavour to <hi>prevent</hi> them, and bring them under, (in the 26. Chap. 17, and 18. Verſes) <hi>Like as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and cryeth out of her pangs; ſo have we been in thy ſight O Lord. We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind, we have not wrought any deliverance in the Earth, neither have the Inhabitants of the world fallen.</hi> Out of a <hi>deep apprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>evil approaching,</hi> great <hi>anxiety</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>Heart,</hi> puts them upon <hi>earneſt endeavours,</hi> to bring down the <hi>Enemy</hi> that is <hi>ariſing,</hi> to hinder the <hi>old ſmitings</hi> again: But all will not do, nothing is brought forth but <hi>wind;</hi> no <hi>deliverance</hi> is wrought in the Earth; the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the world <hi>fall not;</hi> but inſtead thereof, <hi>they fall</hi> themſelves to the <hi>death; Thy DEAD men ſhall live,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So that now I ſuppoſe, I may without preſumption ſay, This is <hi>our Scripture;</hi> belongs to us, as a <hi>teaching Leſſon,</hi> particularly appointed for us at <hi>this day</hi> to learn.</p>
            <p>The Words contain, the <hi>Work</hi> the Lord will perform upon <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> till which is performed, he will not <hi>puniſh</hi> the ſtout heart of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> nor <hi>burn</hi> the Rod with which he is <hi>ſcourging</hi> and <hi>correcting</hi> his People for their unchild-like carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him their Father.</p>

            </p>
            <q>Hath he SMITTEN him, as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him? Or, is he SLAIN, according to the ſlaughter of them that are ſlain by him?</q>
            <p>It's the <hi>ſame manner</hi> of <hi>ſmiting</hi> with which <hi>Jacob in former times ſmote</hi> his Enemies.

            </p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Jacob</hi> goes into <hi>by-wayes,</hi> wayes of his <hi>own invention,</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> his <hi>Blood,</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> his <hi>Life,</hi> and behold he <hi>loſes</hi> it; making good that ſaying of our Lord, <hi>He that ſeeks to ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> Sinning <hi>Jacob</hi> (in his <hi>Laodicean</hi> frame of Spirit) cryes out with the ſloathful perſon (<hi>Prov.</hi> 26.13.) <hi>A Lion is in the Way, a Lion is in the Street</hi> the Lord would have me paſs through; and <hi>fleeing</hi> from this <hi>Lion,</hi> a <hi>Bear meets</hi> him, and <hi>tears</hi> him and <hi>rends</hi> him, as <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeaks.</p>

            <q>In the day of the Eaſt Wind.</q>
            <p>In <hi>that day</hi> in which the Lord hath appointed the <hi>Eaſt Wind</hi> to blow; which is, when the <hi>Rough VVind,</hi> the <hi>ſmitings</hi> and <hi>ſlayings,</hi> the <hi>Affliction,</hi> hath done <hi>its work</hi> for which it was ſent, upon <hi>Jacob;</hi> then, in <hi>that day,</hi> will the Lord <hi>ſtay</hi> this <hi>Rough VVind,</hi> put a <hi>ſtop</hi> to theſe <hi>ſmitings</hi> and <hi>ſtayings, take away</hi> this <hi>Affliction:</hi> And that, by <q>The Eaſt VVind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall ſee what <hi>VVind</hi> this is (that <hi>taking place</hi> at its <hi>appointed

            <p>When the <hi>Rough VVind,</hi> the <hi>ſmitings</hi> and <hi>ſlayings,</hi> the <hi>preſent Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> hath wrought its <hi>proper Effect</hi> upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> then is the <hi>time come,</hi> and a ſtrong <hi>Eaſt VVind</hi> from the preſence of the Lord ſhall <hi>blow</hi> and <hi>ſtop</hi> the <hi>breath</hi> of the <hi>Rough VVind.</hi> The Lord will <hi>ſo deal</hi> with this <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Jacob's trouble,</hi> the <hi>VVaves</hi> whereof are <hi>roaring</hi> upon <hi>poor Jacob,</hi> as that, <hi>a VVay</hi> through the <hi>Sea, a VVay</hi> through the <hi>Rough VVind, a VVay</hi> through the very <hi>ſmitings</hi> and <hi>ſlayings</hi> of the Enemy, ſhall <hi>be made</hi> and <hi>found out,</hi> for <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>eſcape.</hi> And what then? <hi>The Light of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be for a fire, and his holy One for a flame, and it ſhall burn and devour his thorns and his bryars</hi> (that are ſcratching and tearing the fleſh of diſtreſſed <hi>Jacob</hi>) <hi>in one day,</hi> Chap. 10.17. In <hi>ONE day:</hi> A day known to the Lord; even <hi>that day,</hi> wherein he will (ſtaying his Rough Wind by his Eaſt Wind, putting a ſtop to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie's ſmiting and ſlaying of his <hi>Jacob,</hi> healing his <hi>VVounds</hi>) <hi>Puniſh</hi> the ſtout heart of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and the glory of his high looks; conſuming his glory, that they ſhall be (as feeble and weak) as when a Standard-bearer fainteth.</p>
            <p>To prevent Objections that might ariſe, I lay down this Poſition: <hi>That, this ſmiting and ſlaying of theſe two Seeds of each other, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, not to ſeveral Generations (Father and Son) but ſhall have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance to the full, in the ſpace of the time of one Generation;</hi> And that upon theſe grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Lord in this very Scripture it ſelf, doth clearly hint thus much, by ſpeaking in the Preſent tenſe; <hi>Is he ſlain according to the ſlaughter of them that are ſlain by him?</hi> that the <hi>SAME GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATION of</hi> Jacobs <hi>Seed, who are ſmitten, and part of whom are ſlain, by their Enemies, ſhall get up again and ſlay them with a greater ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> limiting it to a <hi>ſhort ſpace of time</hi> for performance of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>CAUSE</hi> that brings this <hi>Sore</hi> &amp; <hi>Dreadful Diſpenſation</hi> upon the <hi>Seed of Jacob,</hi> is, <hi>their SIN.</hi> This is <hi>ſtrongly</hi> and <hi>cloſely implyed</hi> in the 9.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is a People ROBBED and SPOILED; they are all of them SNARED IN HOLES, and they are hid in PRISON-HOUSES: they are for a PREY, and none delivereth: for a SPOIL, and none ſaith, Reſtore.

            <p>It's <hi>Jacobs Sin</hi> that <hi>Cauſes</hi> the Lord to viſit him in wayes of <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Correction;</hi> it's his <hi>Sin</hi> that <hi>Cauſes</hi> the Lord to lay upon him his Fatherly <hi>Chaſtenings</hi> and <hi>Rebukes;</hi> and that in <hi>Love,</hi> that being <hi>cleanſed</hi> from <hi>Sin,</hi> he might be a <hi>partaker</hi> of his <hi>Holineſs.</hi>

            <p>Conſider <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2. <hi>Behold, the Lords hand is not ſhortened, that it cannot ſave; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But YOUR INIQUITIES have ſeparated between you and your God; and YOuR SINS have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</hi> How <hi>nearly</hi> this Scripture doth <hi>concern</hi> us, will appear, if we conſider it doth not <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak</hi> of what God will do in the <hi>laſt dayes,</hi> but to the <hi>Iſlands</hi> alſo, (V. 18.) We ſee here the Lord in a poſture, <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> and to <hi>hear</hi> his People: His <hi>Hand is not ſhortened,</hi> it's <hi>ready prepared</hi> to <hi>ſave;</hi> his <hi>Ear</hi> is not <hi>heavy,</hi> it's <hi>open</hi> to <hi>hear.</hi> There's no ſuch thing, as the <hi>Time</hi> being <hi>not come,</hi> on the <hi>Lords part,</hi> to <hi>hinder</hi> him from <hi>ſaving Jacob:</hi> But it's <hi>Jacob's Sin,</hi> that <hi>Cauſes</hi> the <hi>Separation</hi> between him and his God; It's his <hi>Sin,</hi> that <hi>Cauſes</hi> theſe <hi>Hidings</hi> of the face of his God from him: It's his <hi>Sin,</hi> that <hi>retards</hi> his <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's not <hi>any thing</hi> in the <hi>Enemy,</hi> it's not to ripen his Sin, that he may fill his Meaſure, that ſo the Juſtice of God may fully ſeize upon him (as ſome vainly conceit) that is the <hi>reaſon,</hi> why the Lord ſuffers this <hi>Affliction</hi> to befall his People.</p>
            <p>No, it's <hi>Jacob's own Iniquities [your Iniquities]</hi> it's <hi>Jacob's own Sins [your Sins]</hi> that <hi>Cauſes</hi> God to <hi>ſeparate</hi> himſelf, and <hi>hide</hi> his face from him. Was it, think we, for the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſake, that the Lord might take an occaſion againſt him to deſtroy him, to be as a fire and a flame to him to burn him up? Or, for <hi>Sion's and Jeruſalem's ſake,</hi> for the <hi>ſake</hi> of that <hi>Work</hi> the Lord had to <hi>perform there;</hi> that the Lord made him the <hi>Rod</hi> of his <hi>Anger</hi> againſt his <hi>People,</hi> and by him ſorely <hi>Afflicted him,</hi> ſuffering him to be as <hi>Bryars</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> tearing and rending their fleſh? Surely it was for his <hi>Peoples ſake:</hi> Had not their <hi>Sins</hi> made a <hi>Work</hi> for the Lord to <hi>perform</hi> upon them by a <hi>Rod of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had never <hi>exalted</hi> himſelf over them. No, the Lord <hi>loves his People</hi> better than ſo; if he <hi>Correct</hi> and <hi>Afflict</hi> them, it's for their <hi>own ſake;</hi> not for the <hi>ſake of any other,</hi> that through his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>Affliction,</hi> he might <hi>deſtroy</hi> them. The Lord <hi>loveth Jacob</hi> ſo, that he will <hi>give men</hi> for <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> for his <hi>Life:</hi> but we never find the Lord <hi>giving up his People</hi> for the <hi>ſake</hi> of <hi>any other</hi> under Heaven; either for their <hi>good,</hi> or for their <hi>hurt. Nothing</hi> can bring <hi>Affliction</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jacob</hi> but his <hi>own Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Jacob's Sin</hi> brings <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> upon him; even <hi>then,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:33837:9"/>when the Lord <hi>is ready</hi> (his hand is open, prepared) to <hi>beſtow Salvation</hi> upon him; when the Lords <hi>time is come</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>ſave</hi> him: yea, even <hi>then,</hi> when the Lord is <hi>waiting to be gratious</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18.) <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you:</hi> That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here ſpeaks of the <hi>ſame Time,</hi> and to the <hi>ſame People,</hi> he ſpeaks of and to, in his 27. Chap. will clearly appear, if the <hi>whole Chapter</hi> be ſeriouſly conſidered. This <hi>waiting</hi> of God to be <hi>gratious,</hi> is while <hi>Jacob</hi> is under <hi>ſore rebuke</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> as the preceding (17.) Verſe manifeſts. The Lord <hi>waits</hi> that he may be <hi>gracious. Heaven</hi> is ready to <hi>Save,</hi> if <hi>Earth</hi> were but <hi>as ready</hi> to be <hi>Saved.</hi> There's <hi>no Obligation,</hi> no tye upon God to <hi>ſhorten his hand,</hi> to <hi>hinder it</hi> from <hi>Saving,</hi> if <hi>Jacob</hi> were but <hi>prepared</hi> and <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>receive Salvation. Therefore</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you.</hi> How will the Lord <hi>exalt</hi> himſelf, that he may <hi>have mercy? In Judgement;</hi> for the <hi>Lord is a God of Judgement.</hi> The Lord will <hi>exalt</hi> himſelf and his Glory, by his <hi>judging</hi> of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and while this <hi>correcting Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is <hi>working</hi> its <hi>natural Effect</hi> (by the help of the co-working of the mighty Spirit of God) in the <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>Jacob;</hi> he <hi>waits</hi> to be <hi>gracious, waits</hi> to <hi>Save:</hi> he <hi>waits</hi> the good hour, wherein (his <hi>Corrections</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wrought the <hi>deſired Effect</hi>) he may be <hi>gracious;</hi> his <hi>Grace may abound</hi> above <hi>Jacob's Sin,</hi> in <hi>delivering</hi> him out of the hands of all his Enemies, that he may <hi>ſerve him without fear in Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs before him all his dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was it with <hi>Jacob</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs of Old.</hi> The Lord was <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> to <hi>give</hi> him the <hi>Promiſed Land;</hi> the <hi>Time</hi> was <hi>come,</hi> for him to <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs</hi> it; the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of the <hi>Amorites</hi> was <hi>full,</hi> the <hi>Enemy</hi> was <hi>ripe</hi> for <hi>Judgement:</hi> yea, the Lord <hi>told</hi> him ſo, by the mouth of his two <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſſes, Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> (<hi>Num.</hi> 14.8, 9.) <hi>They are bread for us, their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us.</hi> But <hi>Jacob</hi> was <hi>not ready</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> it; his <hi>Sin hinders</hi> his <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>our Caſe.</hi> It's our <hi>own Sin,</hi> (and not anothers) that hath <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and <hi>brought</hi> a <hi>ſore Affliction</hi> upon us.

            </p>
            <p>It's only our <hi>own Sin</hi> that ſtands in the <hi>way</hi> of our <hi>Salvation;</hi> it's that, that <hi>Cauſes</hi> the <hi>preſent Hidings</hi> of the face of our God from us: by it we have as it were <hi>Cauſed God</hi> to go out of that path of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he was <hi>graciouſly</hi> and <hi>wonderfully</hi> going on in; and to ſteer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, that he may <hi>take away our Sin,</hi> that which <hi>hinders</hi> his <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> It may be asked, What are thoſe ſins which have hindered our Salvation; by which we have provoked the Lord our Father ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to chaſtiſe us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> I had thoughts to have enlarged upon this Subject; but leſt I ſhould grieve the Spirits of any; and hoping that a word, a hint, may prove ſufficient, I ſhall do no more.</p>
            <p>This <hi>SIN,</hi> which hath brought <hi>Affliction</hi> upon us, which hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Father of mercies to <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> us with <hi>bloody ſtripes</hi> to <hi>take it away,</hi> is that which hath made us, both <hi>unfit</hi> for God to <hi>uſe</hi> in, and <hi>unable</hi> to do the <hi>Work</hi> the Lord hath appointed to be done by his <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Any <hi>Sin leſs</hi> than <hi>ſuch Sin,</hi> the Lord would have <hi>born</hi> with, and the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of our <hi>Mediator</hi> would have <hi>prevailed</hi> for us; as the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> of old in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> through the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of their <hi>Mediator,</hi> were many times <hi>born</hi> with, and found favour and grace from God, till they came to <hi>ſin that Sin</hi> which <hi>unfitted</hi> them, and put them out of a <hi>capacity,</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> that <hi>great Gift</hi> of his Grace and favour he was in a <hi>readineſs</hi> to <hi>beſtow</hi> upon them, and <hi>to do</hi> that <hi>Work</hi> the Lord had to do by them.</p>
            <p>Now I would only Query, whether ſome <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>parcels</hi> of this <hi>provoking Sin,</hi> be not theſe?</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Love of this Old World.</hi> This is a <hi>killing Sin,</hi> moſt <hi>pernitious</hi> to <hi>Jacob's Happineſs:</hi> while this remains, he cannot be a <hi>fit Inſtrument</hi> for the Lord to <hi>uſe,</hi> and ſo not <hi>fit</hi> for <hi>Deliverance.</hi> See what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith of it, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World: If any man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi> The reaſon of this, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tells us, (<hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4.) <hi>The friendſhip of this VVorld is enmity with God: whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore will be a friend to the VVorld, is the Enemy of God.</hi> How <hi>much,</hi> and how <hi>powerful</hi> this <hi>Sin</hi> hath prevailed amongſt us, and how far it hath hurried us into <hi>other provoking Evils,</hi> every ſeeing eye and diſcerning ſpirit, cannot but be ſenſible of. The reaſons why I put it upon the Query, whether this hath not <hi>provoked</hi> the Lord to <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> us; are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe our Lord Chriſt doth ſo ſeverely warn us to take heed of it,</hi> (Luke 21.34.) <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be over-charged with ſurfeiting, and drunkenneſs, and cares of this Life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares.</hi> In theſe words, he hath <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the <hi>two extream conditions</hi> men are in in this World, <hi>Full</hi> or

This he <hi>equally warns</hi> us of, and <hi>commands</hi> us to <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>pray againſt,</hi> upon no <hi>leſs penalty,</hi> than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>not accounted worthy</hi> to eſcape the <hi>Judgements</hi> of God, and to <hi>ſtand</hi> before the <hi>Son of man</hi> when he <hi>Comes;</hi> for when he <hi>Comes,</hi> he will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have the <hi>ſurfeiting drunken Lover,</hi> nor the <hi>careful Lover</hi> of this World, to be his <hi>Follower:</hi> This is clearly imployed in the 36.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe our Lord Jeſus, to expreſs his hatred of this Sin, ſets forth the wickedneſs of the VVorld at that Day when he comes in Judgement to it; by this, Love of this VVorld,</hi> (Luke 17. from the 26. to the 30. V.) <hi>As it was in the dayes of</hi> Noah, <hi>ſo ſhall it be alſo in the dayes of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married VVives, they were given in Marriage, until the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entered into the Ark, and the Flood came and destroyed them all.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I fear upon a ſerious ſearch, it will be found that our <hi>Love</hi> to our <hi>Stuff,</hi> the good things of this Life, (to keep and maintain our poſſeſſion of theſe) hath hurried us into ſuch by-wayes, ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as have brought <hi>BLOOD</hi> upon us. I ſhall only mention two Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and leave it to a ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If <hi>Baaſha execute Juſtice</hi> upon the <hi>Houſe of Jeroboam,</hi> according to the Word of the Lord, and <hi>become like</hi> the <hi>Houſe of Jeroboam,</hi> in <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs:</hi> that <hi>piece of juſtice</hi> becomes <hi>BLOOD-GUILTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSE</hi> to him; is imputed to him as <hi>Murder,</hi> and he muſt <hi>dye</hi> for it, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.29. &amp; 16.3, 7. V.) <hi>And it came to paſs, when he reigned,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33837:11"/>that he ſmote all the Houſe of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>he left not to</hi> Jeroboam <hi>any that breathed, until he had deſtroyed him, according unto the ſaying of the Lord, which he ſpake by his Servant</hi> Ahijah <hi>the</hi> Shilonite. <hi>Behold, I will take away the Poſterity of</hi> Baaſha, <hi>and the Poſterity of his Houſe, and will make thy Houſe like the Houſe of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. <hi>And alſo by the hand of the Prophet</hi> Jehu, <hi>the Son of</hi> Hanani, <hi>came the Word of the Lord againſt</hi> Baaſha, <hi>and againſt his Houſe, even for all the Evil that he did in the ſight of the Lord, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the Houſe of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>and becauſe he killed him.</hi> That <hi>Blood</hi> which <hi>Baaſha</hi> ſhed (in <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to the <hi>Command</hi> of God by his Servant the Prophet) in a way of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> he walking in the <hi>ſame path</hi> of <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> is <hi>required</hi> at his hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>Jehu execute Juſtice</hi> upon the <hi>Houſe of Ahab,</hi> and do it ſo <hi>exactly</hi> too, as that <hi>every piece</hi> of it is according to the <hi>Word of the Lord,</hi> (as the ſtory mentions, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. &amp; 10. Chapters) Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this <hi>piece of Juſtice,</hi> if done ſo <hi>exactly</hi> according to the <hi>Rule,</hi> to the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord; yet <hi>Jehu,</hi> through the <hi>Love of this World,</hi> not <hi>departing</hi> from the <hi>Sins of Jeroboam,</hi> but doing the <hi>Work</hi> of the Lord <hi>negligently,</hi> by halves, becomes <hi>GUILTY OF THIS BLOOD;</hi> this <hi>act of Juſtice</hi> is <hi>imputed</hi> to him for <hi>Murder,</hi> and the <hi>Blood</hi> is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> at his hand, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4.) <hi>Call his Name</hi> Jezreel; <hi>for yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and I will AVENGE THE BLOOD of</hi> Jezreel <hi>upon the Houſe of</hi> Jehu. I need not add further.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another Branch of the <hi>preſent Afflicting Sin,</hi> that I would mention, I conceive is, <hi>PRIDE;</hi> both <hi>NATURAL</hi> and <hi>SPIRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUAL PRIDE.</hi> How <hi>contrary</hi> this is to the Lord in <hi>all Ages,</hi> at <hi>al times,</hi> I need not mention; the Scriptures are full in expreſſion of it: Therefore, <hi>much more</hi> at <hi>ſuch a time</hi> as this, when his <hi>deſign</hi> is, to be <hi>ALONE exalted;</hi> againſt which, <hi>no Sin</hi> ſets it ſelf <hi>ſo much</hi> in <hi>oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as <hi>this.</hi> This <hi>Sin</hi> ſo extreamly <hi>unfits Jacob</hi> (were he otherwiſe quallified) for the <hi>Work</hi> of God, that the Lord
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16, 17. &amp; 13.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.2. &amp; 86.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.5.</note> 
               <hi>hates</hi> it, it's <hi>Abominable</hi> to him.

            <p>Fourthly, And the laſt I ſhall mention is, <hi>CARNAL Minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33837:12"/>Carnality of Spirit:</hi> And this I would <hi>expatiate</hi> a little upon, becauſe it is the moſt <hi>Spiritual Evil,</hi> and ſo needs the <hi>greateſt battery</hi> gainſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Carnal mind of the Natural man,</hi> who is <hi>after the fleſh, is enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> (Rom. 8.5, 7.) this brings <hi>Death</hi> to him, (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) And the <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remainders</hi> of this <hi>Carnal-mindedneſs,</hi> in the Lords own <hi>people, unfits</hi> them for the <hi>Lords work,</hi> makes them <hi>uncapable</hi> of <hi>doing</hi> it, or being uſed in it: for this keeps them from being <hi>ſubject to the Law</hi> of God, the <hi>Rule of the Lord</hi> by which he will <hi>ſquare his work:</hi> which he hath ſaid, he will <hi>Magnify, and make Honorable,</hi> (Iſa. 42.21.) By this we come to <hi>Dye,</hi> and to be <hi>Dead</hi> to the <hi>Work</hi> of God: If we would live to the <hi>Work</hi> of the Lord, we muſt be <hi>Spiritually</hi> mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to be <hi>ſpiritual minded is Life and Peace,</hi> (ver. 6.) this is that muſt <hi>enable Jacob to take root, and Iſrael to bloſſome, and bud, and fill the Face of the World with fruit. Carnal-mindedneſs</hi> is <hi>Death</hi> to Jacob, by it he becomes as a <hi>withered branch,</hi> bringing forth no fruit to the Lord: for while he is in that mind, he is <hi>not,</hi> neither <hi>can he be</hi> ſubject to the Law <hi>of his Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Carnality of ſpirit,</hi> reſpects either, <hi>Natural worldly fleſh,</hi> as Paul tels. us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>minding the things of the fleſh,</hi> this world, and the good things thereof; which are not of the Father, but of the VVorld; for all that is in the VVorld, <hi>The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but of the World:</hi> which whoſoever loves, <hi>the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> (1 Joh. 2.15, 16.) of which, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world,</hi> (Gal. 6.14.) otherwiſe he could not have been an Apoſtle of Chriſt. Or, it reſpects</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religious fleſh;</hi> ſuch a frame of <hi>Spirit</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as is <hi>Fleſhly and Carnal;</hi> The more <hi>groſs</hi> of this <hi>Sort,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> complains of, as thoſe that would make a fair <hi>ſhew in the Fleſh, that they might glory in the Fleſh;</hi> and that to this <hi>unworthy end, to avoid perſecution</hi> for the Croſſe of Chriſt, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.12, 13.) <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God forbid, that I ſhould Glory, ſave in the Croſs of our</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</hi> ver 14.) This was <hi>Pauls frame of ſpirit, and ſuch only are fit Chriſtians for</hi> Chriſts <hi>ſervice:</hi> There are a more <hi>refined ſort</hi> of theſe <hi>Carnal-minded Chriſtians;</hi> to cure whom, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> takes a a great <hi>deal of pains,</hi> in his three firſt Chapters of his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>the Corrinthians,</hi> to the 8th. <hi>verſe</hi> of the fourth Chapter: Theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:33837:12"/>were Chriſtians of ſuch a high pitch, of ſuch high <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith of them, <hi>In every thing ye are enriched, in all Utterance, and in all Knowledge, ſo that ye come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Notwithſtanding all this, they are yet <hi>Carnal; I could not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſpeak unto you as unto Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, for ye are yet Carnal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See what <hi>Fruit</hi> this <hi>Carnal frame of Spirit</hi> brought forth in theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and then we ſhall know <hi>what it is</hi> to be <hi>Carnal;</hi> to be a <hi>Carnal Chriſtian.</hi>

            <p>Abundance more might be ſaid, to prove this, both from the Old and New Teſtament: <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles yield plentiful proof, that this <hi>frame of Spirit,</hi> is the Onely <hi>true Goſpel frame.</hi> But I forbear.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That we are Commanded in ſeveral Scriptures, in the Old and New Teſtament, to be ſeparate and not touch the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, and to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> upon the penalty of being partaker of her Sins, and ſo of her Plagues: therefore how can this union pleaded for, be according to the mind of God?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer. Its <hi>a certain truth;</hi> that <hi>touching the unclean thing,</hi> and <hi>abiding in Babylon,</hi> are <hi>inconfiſtant</hi> with <hi>this Union</hi> pleaded for. A <hi>Holy Separation</hi> from the <hi>unclean thing,</hi> and <hi>coming out of Babylon,</hi> of <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> muſt <hi>precede</hi> this <hi>Union,</hi> otherwiſe it cannot be; for in a <hi>Defiled houſe</hi> the Lord will <hi>not dwell.</hi> But yet we muſt be careful leſt we call <hi>that unclean,</hi> which the Lord doth <hi>not account</hi> ſo; and ſo <hi>caſt away</hi> that which the Lord will <hi>gather up</hi> as his; and call <hi>that Babylon</hi> which the Lord looks upon as <hi>belonging to his Sion,</hi> though <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>infirm:</hi> Therefore, it's <hi>neceſſary,</hi> to <hi>reſolve</hi> this Caſe, that we conſider what is to be underſtood by this <hi>unclean thing,</hi> and by <hi>coming out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>

Now thoſe <hi>Petty Differences</hi> (I call them <hi>Petty,</hi> becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as <hi>move</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Man;</hi> he ſees them, what they are, and lives above them; they are onely <hi>great and powerful,</hi> to the diſturbance onely of the <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Carnal Chriſtian.</hi> I ſay thoſe <hi>Petty Differences</hi>) that are among the <hi>People of God</hi> (who are planted in, and built upon this true Foundation) are ſo far from being to be <hi>caſt off</hi> (as not agreeing with the Foundation) as that they are not to be <hi>Judged,</hi> (<hi>Judge nothing before the time,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle) but to be <hi>let alone,</hi> to be <hi>born with,</hi> till the <hi>Day declare</hi> of what <hi>ſort</hi> they are.

And the ſame that the Lord <hi>Conſecrated</hi> to himſelf <hi>in that day,</hi> he hath ſaid, he will again <hi>conſecrate</hi> to himſelf <hi>in theſe laſt daies,</hi> when <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall <hi>ariſe and threſh, and beat in pieces many People,</hi> (Mich. 4.13.) and he will as <hi>little bear</hi> with it, in his People <hi>now</hi> as <hi>then;</hi> for this is <hi>One</hi> of <hi>Babylons Sins,</hi> for which the Lord <hi>Judges</hi> her, (Jer. 51.13.) and it's for the <hi>Iniquity of our Covetouſneſs, that the Lord is wroth with us, and ſmites us,</hi> (Iſa. 57.17.)</p>
            <p>Now it's worth our <hi>ſearching</hi> into, whether <hi>Achans ſin,</hi> hath not been one <hi>great cauſe</hi> of that <hi>Stop</hi> put to the <hi>Work</hi> of God, and of that <hi>great Affliction</hi> which is <hi>fallen,</hi> and is yet <hi>falling</hi> upon poor <hi>ſinning Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> at this <hi>Day?</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Conſecrating the gain</hi> unto the Lord;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33837:20"/>have we not <hi>taken it</hi> to our ſelves, and put it among our own <hi>Stuff?</hi> From this <hi>Sin</hi> will the Lord <hi>ſeparate</hi> his People, making them his <hi>Redeemed from the Earth,</hi> (Rev. 14.3.) Notwithſtanding this, and that the Apoſtle tells us, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3.) that <hi>Covetouſneſs ought not to be ſo mnch as named amongſt us, as becometh Saints:</hi> Yet, how <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> have poor <hi>Carnal Chriſtians</hi> been <hi>in this day!</hi> a <hi>ſmall difference,</hi> an <hi>Opinion,</hi> hath cauſed them to <hi>Divide,</hi> to <hi>Separate</hi> and <hi>Flce</hi> from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as from <hi>Monſters;</hi> while in the <hi>mean time,</hi> this <hi>pernitious, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Evil,</hi> is not ſo much as taken <hi>notice of:</hi> Nay, looked on as a <hi>Vertue,</hi> or at leaſt paſt over as an <hi>Infirmity:</hi> For this (as well as for <hi>other Evils</hi>) the Lord is <hi>Judging</hi> his People.</p>
            <p>Let theſe things be <hi>Separated from,</hi> and I think I may ſafely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſumption ſay, the People of the Lord will <hi>quickly come</hi> into ſuch an <hi>undeſiled united State,</hi> that all <hi>that ſee it,</hi> will <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>bleſs</hi> it, as the <hi>Daughters,</hi> the <hi>Queens,</hi> and the <hi>Concubines</hi> did, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9. ſuch a <hi>Light</hi> will ſhine <hi>round about it,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Glory</hi> will ariſe <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> it, that there ſhall be ſuch a <hi>Confluence unto it,</hi> of thoſe who being in <hi>Love</hi> with its <hi>Glory,</hi> are <hi>converted</hi> into it; that we ſhall cry out with <hi>Iſaiah, Who are theſe that flee as the Clouds, and as the Doves to their Windowes, Iſa.</hi> 60.1, 5, 6, 7, and 8. verſes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this part of this Diſcourſe, with the words of the 133. <hi>Pſalm, Behold! how good and pleaſant a thing it is, for Brethren to dwell together in</hi> (this pure) <hi>unity? It's like the precious Ointment upon the Head,</hi> (this Ointment was made of the moſt ſweet and Odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Spices, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23, 24.) ſo that when it was poured out, it made a moſt fragrant ſavour, in the Noſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils of all thoſe that were near unto it) that <hi>run down upon the Beard, even</hi> Aarons <hi>Beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments;</hi> it's the very Image of the holineſs of God, ſtampt upon the <hi>Royal Prieſthood</hi> of the Lord, his <hi>Holy Nation</hi> and <hi>Peculiar People,</hi> that muſt ſhew forth the praiſes of him, that hath called them out of darkneſſe, into his marvellous Light, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.) And that wrought by the mighty working, and <hi>Annointing,</hi> of his Holy Spirit) It is <hi>as the Dew of</hi> Herman, <hi>and as the Dew that deſcended upon the Mountains of</hi> Sion, which made them both pleaſant and fruitful, <hi>for there the Lord commanded the Bleſſing, even Life for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>State and Condition</hi> of his People, which the Lord will <hi>Bleſſe</hi> with an <hi>Everlaſting Bleſſing,</hi> LIFE FOR EVERMORE: which <hi>State</hi> ſhall ſuffer no <hi>alteration</hi> nor <hi>Change,</hi> ſo long as the <hi>Son and Moon indure,</hi> till the time of the Fabrick of this World cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33837:21"/>to be: For upon the dwelling <hi>places</hi> of Sion, and upon her <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> (come into this <hi>State and frame</hi> of Spirit) will the Lord create a <hi>Cloud,</hi> and <hi>Smoke</hi> by <hi>Day,</hi> and <hi>the ſhining of a flaming Fire by Night</hi> (he will work as wonderfully as ever he did of Old) to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this Glory: And there ſhall be a Tabernacle, for a ſhadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from Storme and from Rain;</hi> even from ALL that their <hi>Enemies,</hi> can (by the help of the Powers of Darkneſs) be <hi>able to do</hi> againſt them.</p>
            <p>We come now to conſider the END of the Lord, in <hi>Correcting</hi> and <hi>Afflicting</hi> his People; which is, <q>1. <hi>To take this Sin away.</hi> This is fully expreſſed, <hi>By this therefore ſhall the</hi> INIQUITY <hi>of Jacob be</hi> PUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GED; <hi>and this is all the Fruit, to take away his Sin.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Verſe</hi> gathers up the <hi>preceding verſes</hi> into it.</p>
            <p>By <hi>this!</hi> by what? By the <hi>means</hi> fore-mentioned; by the <hi>Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and</hi> the <hi>Slayings</hi> of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>By this therefore! wherefore? Why will God make uſe of <hi>thoſe means to</hi> purge Jacob? Firſt, becauſe the Lord will <hi>meaſure out the Affliction,</hi> that it ſhall continue no longer then this <hi>effect</hi> is wrought in <hi>Jacob.</hi> Secondly, becauſe he hath in a readineſs <hi>wherewithal to ſtop the Current and Stream of this Affliction,</hi> to ſtay this <hi>rough-wind,</hi> as ſoon as ever it hath wrought its <hi>effect.</hi> If the Lord did not take care of <hi>this,</hi> theſe means would not do the <hi>work,</hi> to which the Lord <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them;</hi> inſtead of purging only, they would <hi>deſtroy</hi> Jacob; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking <hi>away his Sin</hi> only, they would take <hi>away his Being</hi> in this World.</p>
            <p>By this therefore, <hi>ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be Purged; and this is all the fruit, to take away his Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>End</hi> of God in this <hi>Affliction,</hi> is to <hi>Cleanſe,</hi> and <hi>Purifie Jacob</hi> from his <hi>Sin;</hi> yea, from thoſe <hi>ſins</hi> already hinted at: From hence we may lay down this Poſition.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>It's not</hi> SINNING-DEFILED Jacob <hi>God will</hi> DELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER; <hi>but it's</hi> CLEANSED and PURIFIED Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob; <hi>whoſe iniquity is Purged, and whoſe ſin is taken away, the Lord will beſtow his ſalvation upon.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Therefore it is, that the Lord will <hi>wait to be gracious;</hi> he is <hi>waiting</hi> upon Jacob, till the <hi>means</hi> he hath appointed (the <hi>Affliction</hi>) hath wrought its <hi>effect (Waſhed and Cleanſed</hi> Jacob from his <hi>Sin,</hi> and the Daughtets of <hi>Sion</hi> from their <hi>Filth,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from her <hi>Blood</hi>) that he may <hi>Deliver</hi> and <hi>Save</hi> him; that he may bleſſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33837:21"/>he may <hi>Take root,</hi> and Iſrael may <hi>bloſſome and Bud, and fill</hi> the <hi>Face of the World with Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord will put a <hi>Glory</hi> upon <hi>Sion;</hi> and then <hi>create a defence</hi> upon all that Glory: but firſt he will <hi>Waſh</hi> and <hi>Purge</hi> her from her <hi>Filth,</hi> and from her <hi>Blood,</hi> (Eſa. 4.) and that by the great and <hi>terrible work</hi> mentioned in the ſecond and third Chapters; Chriſt will make his Spouſe, <hi>Terrible as an Army with Banners,</hi> yea, <hi>as the company of two Armies:</hi> But firſt he will make her <hi>ſick of Love,</hi> exerciſing her under ſore <hi>Afflictions,</hi> the <hi>Smitings,</hi> and <hi>Woundings</hi> of the <hi>Watchmen,</hi> and the <hi>Robery</hi> of the <hi>Keepers of the Wall;</hi> till ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>undefiled,</hi> looking forth as the <hi>morning,</hi> fair as the <hi>Moon,</hi> and clear as the <hi>Son,</hi> (<hi>Cant.</hi> 5. and 6. <hi>Chapters</hi>) God will enable his People to tread <hi>down the wicked like Aſhes under the Soles of their Feet:</hi> But firſt he will ſit as a <hi>Refiner</hi> and <hi>Purifier of Silver,</hi> Purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and <hi>Purging</hi> them as Gold and Silver is Purged in the Fire; <hi>Purging away their droſs, and taking away all their Tin</hi> (Mal. 3. <hi>and</hi> 4. Chapters, compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15.) The Lord Chriſt, hath a <hi>great and glorious work to</hi> lead forth his people to do in the World: but firſt he writes his <hi>Fathers Name</hi> in their Fore-head; he <hi>redeems</hi> them from the Earth, from <hi>among men;</hi> makes them <hi>Pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> having no <hi>Guile</hi> at all in them, <hi>without fault</hi> before the Throne of God, and then they <hi>follow the Lamb whitherſoever</hi> he leads them, into what <hi>Path,</hi> or whatſoever <hi>work</hi> he pleaſes, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.) Yea, Chriſt hath <hi>Vials full of wrath,</hi> to pour out upon the Earth: But he will pour them out, by <hi>Angels cloathed in pure and White linen,</hi> having their Breaſts girded about with <hi>Golden Girdles</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 16.) The Lord will <hi>deſtroy Babylon;</hi> but he will do it by his <hi>Sanctified ones,</hi> ſuch as rejoice in his Highneſs, (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 13.3.) Chriſt hath a People that ſhall <hi>Reign with him;</hi> but they muſt firſt <hi>ſuffer with him,</hi> (2 Tim. 2.12.) If Chriſts Witneſſes will aſcend up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> as Chriſt did, they muſt firſt be conformable to his <hi>Death,</hi> (Rev. 11.) If it were <hi>neceſſary that Chriſt himſelf,</hi> though he were a <hi>Son, ſhould learn obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the things which he ſuffered,</hi> (Heb. 5.8.) much more will it appear <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that we ſhould through <hi>ſuffering learn to obey thoſe</hi> commands, which God in theſe laſt daies hath laid upon his people, as his will they ſhould do, which are ſo contrary to fleſh and blood, and hard for it to bear. And if it <hi>Became the Captain of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to be made <hi>Perfect through Suffering,</hi> (Heb. 2.10.) how much more <hi>Becoming</hi> is it, that his Followers, his Members, ſhould goe on to <hi>Perfection through the ſame Path of Sufferings?</hi> hence it is, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33837:22"/>the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes <hi>this the Path,</hi> through which he expected to attain that <hi>Perfection,</hi> he ſo earneſtly preſt after, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10, 11, &amp;c.) <hi>That I may know him, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made conformable unto his Death: If by any means, I might attain to the Reſurrection of the Dead; not as though I had already attained, either were already Perfect, &amp;c.</hi> So here in this Propheſy, <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt <hi>take root,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt <hi>bloſſome</hi> and <hi>bud;</hi> but, that he may be thus <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> the Lord will firſt <hi>Purge</hi> him from his <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>his Sin,</hi> and that by a <hi>Sore</hi> and <hi>Sharp Affliction,</hi> a <hi>Smiting,</hi> and <hi>Slaying Affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have Enumerated theſe Inſtances, to hint theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Agreement</hi> that there is between the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in holding forth to us, the <hi>Manner of Gods proceeding</hi> with his People, in order to <hi>fit</hi> them for his <hi>Salvation,</hi> and ſo for that <hi>Work</hi> he hath to do by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God will not have his <hi>Work</hi> done with <hi>Defiled,</hi> but with <hi>Pure hands,</hi> according to that word, (<hi>Job</hi> 22.30. (<hi>He ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Iſland of the Innocent: and it is delivered by the Pureneſs of thine hands,</hi> or (as it is in the Margent of ſome Bibles) <hi>The Innocent ſhall Deliver the Iſlands. Impure, foul and dirty hands,</hi> will ſo <hi>ſully</hi> and <hi>Beſmear</hi> the <hi>Work</hi> of God, that it will appear more like <hi>Mans Work,</hi> than <hi>Gods Work;</hi> and ſo the Lord loſes the <hi>Glory of his Works:</hi> now becauſe he will not loſe this <hi>Glory,</hi> nor ſuffer it to be given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;</hi> he therefore comes to his People with <hi>Smarting</hi> and <hi>Bloody Strokes,</hi> with <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>with Sope,</hi> to <hi>Purge</hi> and <hi>Cleanſe</hi> them, that they may do his <hi>Work</hi> ſo, that it may <hi>Evidently appear</hi> to be <hi>Gods Work,</hi> had not <hi>Mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How far what hath <hi>been done,</hi> and <hi>befaln us</hi> in our daies, doth confirm this; let the <hi>Seeing Eye, and understanding Heart</hi> judge. I ſhall give but one <hi>Inſtance</hi> more to confirm the Poſition, and that is, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.21. <hi>and</hi> 23. <hi>verſes. He hath not beheld Iniquity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither hath he ſeen Perverſneſs in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>the</hi> Lord <hi>his</hi> God <hi>is with him, and the ſhout of a King is among them: Surely there is no inchantment againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither is there any Divination againſt</hi> Iſrael; <hi>according to</hi> THIS TIME, <hi>it ſhall be ſaid of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>What hath God wrought?</hi> the Sinning rebellions of Jacob was <hi>Judged, Died</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> but this <hi>Judgement</hi> of God upon him, having <hi>Purged</hi> Jacob from his <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>taken away</hi> his <hi>Sin;</hi> that the Lord, <hi>beholds not iniquty in</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither ſees perverſneſs in</hi> Iſrael: but they are brought into a <hi>Purified, humble, Obedient State; According to</hi> THIS TIME <hi>it ſhall be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33837:22"/>ſaid of Jacob, and of Iſrael, what hath God wrought?</hi> This is the <hi>Time,</hi> wherein they ſhall be <hi>Bleſſed</hi> with <hi>Bleſſings</hi> that men cannot <hi>reverſe,</hi> verſe 20. <hi>and no Inchantment nor Divination ſhall prevail againſt them:</hi> wherein God wil <hi>Bleſs</hi> him that <hi>Bleſſes</hi> them, &amp; <hi>Curſe</hi> him, that <hi>Curſes</hi> them, <hi>Ch.</hi> 24.19. From this <hi>Time</hi> it is, that <hi>ſuch Bleſſings</hi> ſhall attend <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſuch <hi>great things</hi> the Lord will do for him, and by him, that thoſe who believe the <hi>Works</hi> of God, ſhall with <hi>great Admiration</hi> cry out, <hi>What hath God wrought!</hi> while Jacobs <hi>Sin</hi> was upon him, he could not <hi>Poſſeſs</hi> the Promiſe, but is <hi>Smitten</hi> by his Enemies: But when the <hi>Corrections</hi> of the Lord upon him, had <hi>Cleanſed,</hi> and <hi>Purged</hi> him from his <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>taken away</hi> his <hi>Iniquity;</hi> then the <hi>Promiſe</hi> was his <hi>Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he entred the <hi>Good Land,</hi> and none could hinder.</p>
            <p>So it <hi>ſtands firm,</hi> both upon <hi>Old and New-Teſtament grounds;</hi> that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> that brings <hi>Correcting Afflictions</hi> upon Jacob, is his <hi>Own Sins,</hi> and his <hi>Own Iniquities:</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of the Lord in <hi>Afflicting,</hi> and <hi>Correcting</hi> of him, is to <hi>take his Iniquity away,</hi> and to <hi>Purge him</hi> from his <hi>Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>2. But the GREAT END of all this is, that he may <hi>Cauſe them that come of Jacob to take Root, and Iſrael to bloſſom and Bud; and fill the face of the world with fruit.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Loves Jacob,</hi> and all his <hi>waies</hi> towards him are <hi>pathes of Love: Love</hi> is in the <hi>Bottom</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all his <hi>Dealings</hi> with Jacob. If he <hi>Correct</hi> and <hi>Afflict</hi> him; it's in <hi>Love,</hi> in <hi>Meaſure,</hi> to <hi>Purge</hi> him from his <hi>Iniquity,</hi> that he may become <hi>Precious in his ſight;</hi> and then in the <hi>ſame Love</hi> that he <hi>Corrects</hi> him, he will <hi>give men for him, and People for his Life,</hi> (Iſa. 43.4.) God will deal in <hi>wrath</hi> with the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I will make a full End of all the Nations,</hi> (Jer. 46.28.) but he <hi>loveth Jacob;</hi> though he <hi>Frowns,</hi> it's in <hi>Love;</hi> though he <hi>ſtrike</hi> it's in <hi>Love;</hi> though he <hi>viſits ſo ſorely,</hi> that the <hi>Rod</hi> even <hi>threatens</hi> the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of Jacob, yet it's <hi>Still in Love;</hi> for though Jacob provokes the Lord to <hi>Command his Enemies,</hi> to go upon <hi>his Walls</hi> and <hi>Deſtroy;</hi> yet this <hi>Love</hi> gives them a <hi>Check,</hi> their <hi>Meaſure,</hi> but <hi>make not a full End,</hi> (Jer. 5.10.) yea, though Jacob's <hi>Sins provoke</hi> the Lord to make a <hi>Deſolation</hi> in the Land, his <hi>Love will not ſuffer him</hi> to make a <hi>full End; yet will I not make a full End,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacobs</hi> Father, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 4.27.) No, the Lord <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Jacob</hi> with an <hi>Everlaſting Love.</hi> If he <hi>Correct,</hi> if he <hi>Smite,</hi> and that to the <hi>drawing of his Blood;</hi> yet, it's <hi>not to deſtroy,</hi> but it's only in <hi>Love,</hi> to <hi>Save</hi> him from his <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſo from that <hi>Deſtiuction</hi> his <hi>Sin</hi> would bring upon him. If the Lord be <hi>Wrath,</hi> ſo that he <hi>Hides his Face,</hi> it's not with <hi>Jacob,</hi> but with his <hi>Sin:</hi> The Lord <hi>Loveth Jacob
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33837:23"/>ſtill: In a little wrath, I hid my face from thee, for a moment, but with Everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy upon thee, ſaith the Lord thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> Iſa. 54.8.</p>
            <p>So that here's the <hi>Great End</hi> of God in his <hi>Dealings</hi> with Jacob, that he may <hi>Fit</hi> him for, and ſo <hi>Beſtow</hi> upon him <hi>Everlaſting kindneſs,</hi> Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Mercy.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That in the Laſt Daies, at this Day, the Lord will uſe the ſame means to Purge, and Cleanſe, and Purifie his People, that he makes uſe of to Deſtroy his and their Enemies, Outward</hi> and <hi>Sore Afflictions, Smiting</hi> and <hi>Slaying, Death</hi> it ſelf.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That this Sore Affliction, the Lord makes uſe of as the means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he will Purge and Cleanſe his People; Ends not in Smiting only, but Proceeds to Slaying, to Blood; ſlain according to the ſlaughter of them, that are ſlain by him.</hi> It ſeems <hi>Jacobs Diſeaſe</hi> is ſo highly <hi>Pluretick,</hi> as the skilfulleſt Phyſitian in Heaven and Earth, can find no <hi>way</hi> to <hi>cure Jacob</hi> of his <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> but by letting out his <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſharpneſs of the Affliction, clearly ſhewes to Jacob, the Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of his Sin.</hi> The tender Fathers of our fleſh, <hi>will not lay ſharp and Sore Corrections</hi> upon their Children, but for <hi>exceeding great Faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> If we ſee a tender Father, whipping a beloved Child till the <hi>Blood run down</hi> his back; we ſay, ſurely that Child hath committed ſome exceeding <hi>great fault;</hi> Much more may we ſay <hi>Jacob</hi> hath <hi>Sinned a Great Sin,</hi> when we ſee the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> (who is the Father of Mercies, whoſe thoughts of Mercy are as far above our thoughts, as the Heavens are Higher than the Earth, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.9.) when we ſee him) <hi>Smiting Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Smiting</hi> him to <hi>Blood,</hi> that he even <hi>faints</hi> under his <hi>Correcting</hi> hand; yea, ſo <hi>Sorely Afflicting Jacob,</hi> that were it not <hi>meaſured out</hi> in <hi>meaſures of mercy;</hi> did not the Lord in tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (as it were) ſtand upon his <hi>watch,</hi> to put a <hi>ſtop</hi> to it when it comes to ſuch a <hi>pitch,</hi> it would deprive poor <hi>Jacob</hi> of <hi>Being:</hi> This ſurely is an open <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of <hi>Jacob's Sin.</hi> In a caſe like this, we have the Lord <hi>mourning</hi> over him, (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.8.) <hi>How ſhall I give up</hi> Ephraim! <hi>How ſhall I deliver thee Iſrael! How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admath! <hi>How ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim! <hi>mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The continuance of this Sore and ſharp Diſpenſation, will be either Lengthned or Shortned, according as Jacob behaves himſelf under it; as he is Obedient or Diſobedient to the voice of the Rod,</hi> (Iſa. 1.19, 20.) <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land; but if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured with the Sword. Jacob's</hi> willingly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God, may prevent this devouring Sword's paſſing over him; but if <hi>Jacob</hi> will not, it muſt have its courſe, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. This <hi>Affliction</hi> muſt <hi>abide</hi> till it hath wrought its <hi>Effect, Purged Jacob</hi> of his <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and taken <hi>away</hi> his <hi>Sin:</hi> So that the <hi>ſooner Jacob</hi> departs from his <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>ſooner</hi> will <hi>the Rod of</hi> Gods diſpleaſure be <hi>taken off</hi> his back. Conſider again, that place we have already diſcanted upon, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2.) <hi>Behold the Lords hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave; but your Iniquities have ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between you and your God; and your Sins have hid his Face from you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33837:24"/>that he will not hear.</hi> The Lord is now as <hi>Able,</hi> ſo <hi>Ready</hi> to beſtow <hi>Salvation;</hi> it's only our <hi>own Sin,</hi> that hinders his hand from <hi>Saving,</hi> and his eare from <hi>Hearing</hi> our cry: If we would but <hi>turn</hi> from our <hi>Sin</hi> (which brought the <hi>Rod</hi> upon us) the Lord would <hi>Hear</hi> and <hi>Save us</hi> immediately. The Lord is ſo <hi>ready to ſave,</hi> that he is <hi>waiting</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his watch) to ſee when we will return to him, that he <hi>may ſave us. Deliverance</hi> is fixed to <hi>no Time,</hi> but only to the <hi>Time</hi> of our <hi>Turning</hi> from <hi>our Sin;</hi> the <hi>ſooner we Turn</hi> from it, the <hi>ſooner</hi> we ſhall be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> till we turn from it, we ſhall not <hi>be Saved;</hi> for the <hi>Rod</hi> is brought upon our back to <hi>Turn</hi> us from it; till which is done, it will <hi>not</hi> be taken off; and as <hi>ſoon as</hi> ever we <hi>Turn</hi> from our <hi>Sin,</hi> the Lord will take <hi>that oportunity,</hi> that <hi>Time</hi> to ſhew forth his <hi>Almighty power,</hi> and get him ſelf a <hi>Name,</hi> and a <hi>Praiſe</hi> in the Earth, in <hi>Saving</hi> of his People.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p>Whatſoever we forſake for his <hi>Sake,</hi> to <hi>follow him,</hi> and keep <hi>cloſe</hi> to him, he will not ſuffer us to be <hi>loſers</hi> by it; if we loſe a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> any poſſeſſion in this world, to <hi>follow</hi> him, to <hi>keep</hi> him <hi>company</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> he will give it us <hi>again</hi> there with <hi>advantage,</hi> according to the Promiſe of our Lord <hi>Jeſus: Every one that hath forſaken houſes, or Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, for my Names ſake, ſhall receive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit Everlaſting life,</hi> Mat. 19.29.

            <p>NO thing can <hi>Provoke</hi> the God of Jacob (the God and Father of Mercies) to throw him into the <hi>Furnace of Affliction,</hi> and to pour down his <hi>Fury</hi> upon him, but ſuch a degree <hi>of Sin,</hi> as will either (being let alone) <hi>Deſtroy Jacob,</hi> ſeperate him from his God; or <hi>Deprive God of his Glory,</hi> even the <hi>Glory</hi> of thoſe <hi>Great and Wonderful things</hi> he hath done for his <hi>Jacob;</hi> and even then, when he is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to deal with him in wrath and anger, his <hi>Eternal Love,</hi> is at the <hi>Bottome</hi> of all, <hi>to draw Jacob Neerer</hi> to himſelf, and to make <hi>him</hi> the People of his <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Glory: I have Refined thee, but not with Silver; I have Choſen thee in the Furnace of Affliction, for mine own ſake, even for mine own ſake will I do it: For how ſhould my Name be Polluted?</hi> and <hi>I will not give my Glory to another,</hi> (Iſa. 48.10, 11.) Therefore it is, that when theſe <hi>Effects</hi> are wrought; the Lord ſo often ſpeaks of <hi>Burning the Rod</hi> wherewith he <hi>Corrects</hi> them, and puniſhing their <hi>Perſecutors, and Afflictors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the Dealings of the Lord with us, may not ſeem <hi>too hard</hi> nor <hi>diſcouraging,</hi> but <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>full of Grace and Love. I</hi> would mind you of two Scriptures; the firſt is, <hi>Num.</hi> 14. <hi>from</hi> 20. <hi>to</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I have pardoned according to thy word; But as truly as I live, all the Earth ſhall be filled with the</hi> Glory <hi>of the</hi> Lord; <hi>becauſe all thoſe men which have ſeen my</hi> Glory, <hi>and my Miracles, which I did in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and in the</hi> Wilderneſs, <hi>and have tempted me now theſe ten times, and have not hearkned to my voice; ſurely they ſhall not ſee the</hi> Land, <hi>which I ſware unto their</hi> Fathers; <hi>neither ſhall any of them which provoked me ſee it, but my ſervant</hi> Caleb; <hi>becauſe he had another Spirit with him (and hath followed me fully,) him will I bring into the Land, whereinto he went, and his</hi> Seed <hi>ſhall poſſeſs it. (Now the</hi> Amalekites, <hi>and the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites <hi>dwelt in the Valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the Wilderneſs, by the way of the</hi> Red Sea.</p>
            <p>We find theſe Children of Iſrael in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> very near <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> very neer their <hi>journies End,</hi> when theſe words were ſpoken unto them. They were very neer going out of their <hi>Wandering Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs State,</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi> a <hi>ſetled happy Condition,</hi> ſetled upon the <hi>Lords Foundation;</hi> but their unbelief brought forth <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the Lord and his Meſſengers (Caleb <hi>and</hi> Joſhuah) which hurryed them back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Wilderneſs State,</hi> by the <hi>way of the Red Sea;</hi> the ſame way, by which they came out of <hi>Bondage,</hi> that muſt be the <hi>way</hi> now, by which they return into <hi>Miſery.</hi> Theſe words are the Lords <hi>anſwer to Moſes,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:33837:28"/>upon his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> on behalf of <hi>Provoking Iſrael.</hi> God had ſaid in his <hi>Wrath</hi> he would <hi>Smite</hi> this People, and <hi>Diſinherit</hi> them, and make of Moſes a greater and a mightier Nation than they; but upon Moſes his <hi>Earneſt Interceſſion</hi> (who was the Mediator of that outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that was between the Lord and this People, as a Nation) the Lord is <hi>Pacified,</hi> he grants him his requeſt as far as would ſtand with his Glory; ſaith the Lord, <hi>I have pardoned according to thy word;</hi> but <hi>as truly as I live, all the earth ſhall be filled with the glory of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, to <hi>ſpare</hi> all this People, the <hi>Rebbels,</hi> as well as the <hi>Innocent,</hi> will not ſtand with the <hi>Glory of my Name,</hi> thou ſo much pleadeſt to me; but I will do ſo, and ſo, and by this means will I glorifie my <hi>Name,</hi> this <hi>Evil Congregation</hi> have <hi>Diſpiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would but take notice of a few things in the words, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are worth your obſerving.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The SIN <hi>which thus provokes the Lord.</hi> It's no <hi>Common Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sin,</hi> (for ſuch Moſes their Mediator would have prevailed for pardon; this People had Sinned againſt the Lord nine times before, and all that was pardoned) but this <hi>Sin,</hi> is ſuch a <hi>Sin,</hi> as touches the <hi>Lords Glory,</hi> the <hi>Glory of his Name,</hi> that he had gotten to himſelf, by all thoſe <hi>Woundrous Works</hi> he had done for them. It was <hi>Unbelief</hi> (to ſuch a Degree as was) <hi>Deſpiſing the voice of the</hi> Lord, <hi>in the mouth of his faithful Witneſſes;</hi> and running <hi>back towards</hi> Egypt, towards that <hi>State and Condition,</hi> to <hi>Deliver them</hi> out of which, the Lord had <hi>wrought ſo wonderfully;</hi> thereby <hi>deſpiſing that Bleſſed State and Condition,</hi> the Lord had <hi>Promiſed,</hi> and was <hi>Ready</hi> to bring them into. This tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Eyes of Gods Glory to the quick, and brings down <hi>Devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Judgements</hi> upon their head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See their SAD CONDITION, their Sin brought them into. <hi>They cannot ſtand before their Enemies;</hi> the Nation Curſed from the Lord, (to be rooted out from having a being upon the face of the Earth) <hi>Amaleck</hi> drives them back into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and they muſt return by the <hi>way of the Red Sea, back towards</hi> Egypt; they would needs return to Egypt, wickedly ſaying, It were better for us to return to Egypt, than to run through thoſe Straits, Dificulties and Dangers we muſt paſs through and overcome, if we get <hi>Canaan:</hi> Therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>get you into the wilderneſs, by the way of the Red Sea;</hi> you have ſeen a little of <hi>Canaan,</hi> at a diſtance; now go look upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> ſee the <hi>Difference;</hi> that FEARED DEATH you would <hi>Run from,</hi> through your own <hi>Inventions,</hi> ſhall ſeize you in the <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> in your returning towards <hi>Egypt;</hi> that <hi>Condition,</hi> to <hi>Deliver</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:33837:28"/>you out of which, I have done ſuch <hi>Great things.</hi> Saith the Lord, you will not <hi>Believe</hi> me, though I confirmed my Promiſe to your Fathers with an Oath; and to perſwade you to <hi>Believe</hi> me, I ſhewed you <hi>my Glory,</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of my <hi>Power,</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of my <hi>Faithfulneſſe,</hi> in working <hi>Miracles in Egypt,</hi> for your <hi>Deliverance,</hi> and bearing with you theſe nine times in this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> ſtill doing <hi>Woundrous Works</hi> before your Eyes, to convince you of the <hi>Folly</hi> of your <hi>unbelief,</hi> and of the <hi>Stability</hi> of my <hi>Promiſe:</hi> yet, you are ſtill <hi>Tempting</hi> of me, and this <hi>Temptation</hi> of yours doth ſo far <hi>Cloud my Glory,</hi> that I will not <hi>bear</hi> with it; but I will ſwear unto you, <hi>as truly as I live</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>as ye have ſpoken in mine Eares, ſo will I do to you,</hi> (verſ. 28.) Will you <hi>Believe me</hi> now? you ſay, you ſhall dye, and I will not Perform my Promiſe in giving you the Good Land, for there are ſo many Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and great Straits, in the way to the poſſeſſion of it, that neither you nor I, are able to remove them, (this was the purport of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,) well! ſaith God, it ſhall be ſo, you ſhall be in the truth, though I be counted the lyar; but before I have done with you, I <hi>will make you know my breach of promiſe,</hi> (verſ. 34.) <hi>in bearing your Iniquities,</hi> taſting the fruit of your ſin; you ſhall know that it's <hi>You</hi> that have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Covenant, <hi>not I;</hi> and that it's <hi>your Sin</hi> grown up to ſuch <hi>a height,</hi> that it will <hi>not conſiſt</hi> with the <hi>Glory of my Name</hi> (that <hi>Glory</hi> which I have gotten to my ſelf by all thoſe <hi>Woundrous Works</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> I wrought for your deliverance, and among you, while I have been lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you through this Wilderneſs) to ſpare you at this time, which is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of your <hi>falling ſhort</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> into <hi>Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Gods END in all this ſeverity towards his Iſrael, is, <hi>The vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his Name, of his Glory: As truly as I live, all the Earth ſhall be filled with the Glory of the Lord: Glory,</hi> is the <hi>Great End</hi> the Lord propoſes to himſelf, in <hi>all his Works:</hi> Therefore it's no wonder he is ſo <hi>highly provoked</hi> when he ſees any about to <hi>Rob him</hi> of his <hi>Glory.</hi> The Lord had gotten himſelf a <hi>Glorious Name</hi> among the Heathen, by thoſe <hi>Great things,</hi> thoſe <hi>Wondrous Works,</hi> he had done for this People, and upon their Enemies for their ſake; and theſe <hi>Unbelieving Provoking Children,</hi> would make him <hi>loſe all that Glory</hi> by their <hi>unbelief,</hi> and their going about to return <hi>to Egypt,</hi> that <hi>State and Condition,</hi> out of which the Lord had <hi>Delivered them</hi> by a <hi>Mighty Out-ſtretched Arme:</hi> This <hi>Provokes</hi> the Eyes of Gods Glory; their Tongue, and their doings, were againſt the Lord, to the Provoking the Eyes of his Glory, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.8.) and he ſhewes himſelf a <hi>Jealous God,</hi> (for ſo he will be at ſuch a time,) <hi>I will be Jealous for my Holy Name,</hi> (Ezek. 39.25.) and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33837:29"/>this <hi>Glory</hi> the Lord will not part with; <hi>I will not give my Glory unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> (Iſa. 42.8.) This <hi>Choſen People,</hi> by their <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Great Unbelief,</hi> would not ſuffer God to <hi>reap this Glory</hi> of his Name from them, nor by them; ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will not loſe it,</hi> for the <hi>Same Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of my Name, theſe deny to give unto me, will <hi>I have</hi> (and fill the Earth with it, all the Earth ſhall be filled with my Glory) and that by <hi>their Deſtruction,</hi> performing my <hi>Promiſe</hi> to my <hi>faithfull follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and their <hi>Little Ones,</hi> whom their <hi>unbelief</hi> ſaith, ſhal become a <hi>Prey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord is <hi>ſo Jealous of his Glory,</hi> leaſt it ſhould be given to any other; that, as he will be <hi>prevailed with,</hi> to pardon every <hi>Sin,</hi> but ſuch a Sin as <hi>Clouds his Glory,</hi> rather than deſtroy <hi>his Choſen;</hi> ſo he will deſtroy <hi>all</hi> things, yea, part <hi>with his Choſen People,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> them (as to their being in this life) rather than <hi>part with his Glory;</hi> that <hi>Great Fruit,</hi> he expects to reap from all his <hi>Great Works,</hi> both of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now all theſe things happened unto them for enſamples, and they are written for our Admonition, upon whom the Ends of the world are come:</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 11.) not only for the Corinthians, but for ours alſo, <hi>upon whom the Ends of the world are come.</hi>

               <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon Sion, for the time to favour her, yea, the ſet time is come: for thy ſervants take pleaſure in her Stones, and favour the Duſt thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Pſalm treats of a very ſore <hi>Afflicting Day,</hi> that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal the people of God, the whole of it evidently demonſtrates: And that it concerns us in theſe <hi>laſt Daies, the Generations</hi> (of Sion then) to <hi>come,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> (then) <hi>not created</hi> (not then brought within the compaſs of the Walls of Sion, to praiſe the Lord) the 18. <hi>verſe</hi> ſufficiently evidences. If we take a <hi>View of the troubles</hi> of it, we ſhall find it ſo full of <hi>Terrors,</hi> that well may <hi>Jeremy</hi> cry our of it, <hi>Alas for that day is Great, ſo that none is like it, it is even the time of Jacobs Trouble.</hi> This DAY:</p>
            <p>It's the <hi>Day</hi> wherein God hides <hi>his ſace from his Choſen,</hi> and ſeems (though he be a God hearing Prayer) to be deaf unto his cry: imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 1. and 2. <hi>verſes.</hi> It's the day of Gods <hi>Indignation and Wrath;</hi> wherein the Lord in <hi>Wrath caſts him down,</hi> who formerly in <hi>Mercy and Loving-kindneſs</hi> he had <hi>lifted up,</hi> (verſe 10.) And the wrath of <hi>God</hi> waxeth ſo hot againſt this Afflicted, that it burns bis <hi>Bones</hi> as an hearth, and by it his daies <hi>are conſumed</hi> like Smoke, (<hi>ver.</hi> 3.) The ſtrokes of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33837:29"/>Gods wrath are ſuch, that they make him <hi>groan ſorely,</hi> and <hi>weep with a bitter weeping,</hi> (verſ. 5.9.) to the <hi>withering and breaking</hi> of his heart, verſ. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It</hi> deprives him of all his <hi>Outward Comforts,</hi> drives him into the <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> into the <hi>Deſarts</hi> (implyed in the 9. and 6. <hi>verſes</hi>) and as to his friends and acquaintance, he is quite become <hi>Deſolate,</hi> left <hi>alone, forfaken</hi> of all (implyed in the 6. and 7. <hi>verſes</hi>) And add to this, the <hi>Reproaches</hi> of the enemy (<hi>ver.</hi> 8.) which is a very ſore affliction.</p>
            <p>It's a <hi>Day</hi> wherein enemies not only <hi>Reproach,</hi> but are <hi>Mad againſt the Afflicted,</hi> through hatred and malice, having loſt the right uſe of their reaſon, they become <hi>Mad</hi> againſt him; and theſe are <hi>Sworn againſt him,</hi> to the taking away his life, (<hi>v.</hi> 8. comp. with v. 20.)</p>
            <p>It's a <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Groaning of Priſoners,</hi> a Day wherein Priſons are filled with the Afflicted, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>It's a <hi>Day</hi> wherein ſome of the Afflicted are <hi>Appointed to Death;</hi> or become the <hi>Children of Death,</hi> (as the margent of ſome Bibles hath it, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.) Yea, It's the <hi>Day,</hi> wherein <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall become ſo <hi>Deſolate,</hi> that her <hi>Buildings,</hi> (her Aſſemblies and Societies) ſhall be broken <hi>to Peices;</hi> her <hi>Stones ſcattered</hi> here and there; and her <hi>Cement Crumbled into duſt,</hi> (this is ſtrongly implyed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.) of all her Buildings, there's only the <hi>Stones</hi> and the <hi>Duſt</hi> left.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this, is that of Iſaiah, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1, 2, <hi>and</hi> 4. <hi>verſes</hi>) ſpeaking to the <hi>City where</hi> David <hi>dwelt,</hi> (<hi>that City which the Lord did Chuſe out of all the Tribes of Iſrael, to put his Name there,</hi> 1 Kings 14.21.) A Profeſſing People that <hi>Kill Sacriſices,</hi> are full of <hi>Right Outward Performances,</hi> in matters of worſhip (which yet the Lord hared, they were a trouble to him, and he was <hi>weary to bear them,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>Pollution in Morrals;</hi> as the complaint is throughout the firſt Chapter) yet (ſaith God) <hi>I will Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs</hi> Ariel, <hi>and there ſhall be</hi> Heavineſs <hi>and</hi> Sorrow; <hi>and it ſhall be unto me, as</hi> Ariel. <hi>And thou ſhalt be brought down, and ſhall ſpeak out of the Ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall be low out of the Duſt, and thy voice ſhall be as of one that hath a familiar Spirit, out of the Ground; and thy ſpeech ſhall whiſper out of the Duſt.</hi> This City is brought into this <hi>State</hi> of Heavineſ, and Sorrow, of <hi>Lowneſs</hi> and <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> by reaſon of her Hypocriſie (complainned of <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) but immediately before the <hi>Day of her viſitation,</hi> wherein the Lord will turn his hand upon her Enemies, that fight againſt, and <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> her, and <hi>Deſtroying</hi> them <hi>Deliver</hi> her; by his <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Earth quakes,</hi> and great <hi>Noiſe,</hi> with <hi>Storm,</hi> and <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> and the flame of <hi>Devouring Fire.</hi> Thus much ſurely, the 6, 7, and 8. <hi>verſes,</hi> tell us; How far this may, or doth concerne us, <hi>I</hi> leave it to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It's the <hi>Day</hi> wherein the <hi>Afflicted</hi> are (in this ſad Deſolate condition) <hi>quite Deſtitute of any help,</hi> from any under Heaven; implyed in the 17. verſe.</p>
            <p>Yet, <hi>This the Time!</hi> the <hi>ſet Time!</hi> for God to <hi>Ariſe,</hi> and to have <hi>Mercy</hi> upon Sion: For by this <hi>Time,</hi> Sion is ſo <hi>Purged</hi> and <hi>Purified,</hi> that ſhe can offer up an <hi>Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is <hi>Pleaſant</hi> unto the Lord, as <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaks; ſhe is enabled to <hi>Pray</hi> ſuch a <hi>Prayer,</hi> as the Lord will <hi>Reward,</hi> and not deſpiſe; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her cry, he Ariſes to have Mercy upon Sion, he appears in his Glory and Saves her out of all her Troubles; ſo that the Heathens fear the Name of the Lord, all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33837:30"/>the Kings of the Earth his Glory, 15, 16, 17. <hi>verſes.</hi> So that as the <hi>Sin of Jacob</hi> may ſometimes be ſo <hi>Circumſtantiated,</hi> that it engages the Lord for his <hi>Gloriesſake,</hi> (nor to paſs it by, but) to <hi>Deal</hi> with him in <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>Diſpleaſure;</hi> and as the <hi>ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs of Jacob</hi> in his Sin, may ſometimes make his <hi>Affliction Long</hi> and <hi>Great;</hi> So when the Affliction hath wrought its <hi>deſired Effect,</hi> humbled him, and brought him to Gods ſoot; though it bring him never <hi>ſo low,</hi> (and make him never <hi>ſo deſtitute</hi>) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Duſt</hi> (that to the Eye of Reaſon, he can never riſe again) yet then is the <hi>Time</hi> for God to ariſe, and to have Mercy upon his Choſen. The Lord having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>the Impure Buildings</hi> of Sion, and ſeparated the <hi>precious ſtones</hi> from the <hi>Vile,</hi> and <hi>Winnowed its Duſt,</hi> by the rough wind of his ſury, from the <hi>defiling attoms</hi> among it; now is the <hi>Set Time come,</hi> for God to ariſe to have <hi>Mercy</hi> upon Sion, and hear their <hi>cry,</hi> and the <hi>groanings</hi> of the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> and to <hi>loſe thoſe</hi> that are appointed to death; now will the Lord appear in his <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>Build</hi> up Sion; for, this is that <hi>State of</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the ſervants of the <hi>Lord</hi> will take <hi>Pleaſure in,</hi> and <hi>Favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such is <hi>Gods Love</hi> to Jacob, that when he ſeems to <hi>Caſt him off</hi> in wrath and diſpleafure, hiding his face from him; yet then, he <hi>Chuſes him afreſh,</hi> as it were: <hi>I have choſen thee in the Furnace of Affliction;</hi> when the fire of affliction hath Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Jacob, (burnt up his Droſſe and his Tin) then (in this <hi>refining furnace</hi>) the Lord <hi>Chuſes him</hi> to be his. <hi>For mine own ſake, even for my own ſake, will I do it;</hi> for <hi>how ſhould my Name be polluted? and I will not give my Glory unto another.</hi> As the <hi>Lord</hi> will not <hi>Save</hi> nor <hi>Deliver Jacob,</hi> but at ſuch a <hi>Time,</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>Way,</hi> wherein he may ſave his <hi>Glory</hi> too; ſo his <hi>Glory is as much,</hi> (and more) engaged to <hi>Save</hi> and <hi>Exalt Jacob,</hi> as ever it was to <hi>Afflict him,</hi> and caſt <hi>him down; I will not give my Glory to another; nor ſuffer my name</hi> (which is called upon by thee) <hi>to be polluted;</hi> therefore will <hi>I</hi> not <hi>ſuffer</hi> thee to be <hi>cut off,</hi> but <hi>chuſe</hi> thee in this thy <hi>Low Eſtate, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi> thee and <hi>ſave</hi> thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.9, 10, 11. compared with the 14. <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſeeing we have ſuch evidences of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> in all his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations towards his Jacob; let u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
